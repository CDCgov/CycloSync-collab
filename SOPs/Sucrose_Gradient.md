# 1) Purpose/Principle
This job aid describes the procedures to purify Cyclospora oocysts using a differential sucrose gradient.  This is a standard method to recover oocyst with a mean specific gravity above 1.2. The Sheather’s sucrose solution results in the oocyst floating to the surface enabling Cyclospora oocyst collection.

# 6) Safety Precautions
1. Use Universal Precautions, including the use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE) when performing the assay. Wear gloves, lab coat, and eye protection while handling all biological specimens.
2. Use caution when transporting bottles to and from the centrifuge to prevent mixing of layers or resuspensions of pellets. 
3. Periotic checks of centrifuges should be made to be sure no tubes or bottles are leaking. All centrifuge carriers should be disinfected if contaminated.
4. Refer to the decontamination SOP before and after performing laboratory work for guidance on appropriate disinfectants, waste disposal, and cleanup.
5. The decontamination SOP follows established local, state, and federal regulations for proper handling and disposal methods.
6. All safety data sheets (SDS) for hazardous chemicals are available in the lab manual titled "SDS"

# 7) Procedure

## 7.1 Pre-processing sample: Sieving Condensed/Raw feces
1. Cover workspace with plastic backed paper to protect counter.
2. Assemble the sieving apparatus by inserting the sieve (125 µm mesh) into the cap.
3. Close the bottom opening of the plastic cup.
4. Pour the stool suspension/mixture to the RPS cup.
5.  Rinse the stool vial with deionized water and mix it by vortex or shaking, and then pour into the cup containing the sample. 
6. Screw the lid on the cup, mix it using vortex and turn the lid opening over a 50 or 175 mL collection tube, depending on the volume of stool added to the cup.
7. When all the sample has passed through the sieve discard the cup.
8. Add water to the sieved stool sample until 40ml (for the 50ml tube) or 100 ml (in the 175 ml tube).
9. Centrifuge at a setting of Program 1500g for 10 minutes.
10. Aspirate supernatant while leaving the pellet undisturbed.
11. Resuspend the pellet with deionized water or saline and mix it using a plastic transfer pipette. 
For a pellet between 1 and 5 ml of packed material, resuspend to a total volume of 20 ml. For larger pellets, resuspend in 40 ml. 

## 7.2  Recovery of oocysts
1. Dispense 80 ml of 1:4 Sheather’s into a 250 ml gradient bottle. 
2. Mark the side of the bottle, indicating the top (meniscus) of the 1:4 layer. This may help in easily locating the different layers.
3. Carefully dispense or pipette 80 ml of 1:2 Sheather’s under the 1:4 layer. 
4. Mix or vortex the fecal sample and dilute with equal volume 1.5% Alconox solution. Alconox is not advised for samples stored in media containing agar, this can form a white precipitate that will impair further processing.
5. Carefully overlay 40 ml of the fecal sample onto the Sheather’s 1:4 layer.
6. Centrifuge bottles at 1000g for 25minutes at 4°C. 
**Note:** Set for slow acceleration and deceleration if centrifuge allows.
7. Collect the top layer (1:4) by pipetting the supernatant down (about 90 ml) to 1:2 layer.
8. Transfer to a clean 175 ml conical polycarbonate bottle pipette the volume up and down to mix it and transfer half of the volume to another clean 175 ml bottle.
9. Collect the oocyst-enriched layer (about 90 ml) by pipetting the supernatant down to about ½ cm from the pellet. 
10. Transfer into a new 175 ml conical polycarbonate bottle and pipette to mix before transferring half of the liquid to another 175 ml conical polycarbonate bottle (i. 2 conical bottles for each 250 gradient bottle). Discard pellet.
11. Fill bottles containing oocyst-enriched fractions to the shoulder of bottle with saline (total volume ~ 200ml). Balance bottles in centrifuge carrier adapters with dH2O or saline as necessary, cap tight and mix.
12. Centrifuge bottles at a setting of at least 1500g for 10 minutes at 4°C. 
**Note:** set for slow acceleration and deceleration if centrifuge allows. 
13. Aspirate supernatants without disturbing the pellet. 
14. Add 2 ml of saline, resuspend before transferring pellet from the conical bottle into a 50 ml tube, combine each respective pellet layer. 
15. Rinse the conical bottle with ~ 5ml of saline and add to the 50 ml tube.
16. Fill each tube with the 45 ml mark with saline, mix thoroughly and centrifuge for 10 minutes, at least 1500g at 4°C. 
17. Aspirate supernatants, resuspend pellets to 1 ml with PBS and transfer to a new microtube.
18. Check under a bright-field microscope for the presence of cyclospora. Label the tube and keep it at 4°C. 
19. A secondary sucrose gradient may be needed to remove additional contaminants

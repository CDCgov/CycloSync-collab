# DNA Extraction from Sorted Cyclospora Oocysts Using Freeze/Thaw-DNeasy

# 1) Purpose/Principle
This job aid describes the procedures to extract total DNA from oocysts of Cyclospora using freeze and thaw to burst up the oocysts followed by DNA extraction and purification using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit.  This is a standard column based DNA extraction method, with an additional step of freeze/thaw to break up the oocysts wall at the beginning of the procedure. In this method, the standard incubation in presence of proteinase K is extended to three hours in order to better perform the DNA extraction.

# 6) Safety Precautions
1. Use Universal Precautions, including the use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE) when performing the assay. Wear gloves, lab coat, and eye protection while handling all biological specimens.
2. Refer to the decontamination SOP before and after performing laboratory work for guidance on appropriate disinfectants, waste disposal, and cleanup.
3. The decontamination SOP follows established local, state, and federal regulations for proper handling and disposal methods.
4. All safety data sheets (SDS) for hazardous chemicals are available in the lab manual titled "SDS".

# 7) Procedure
## 7.1 Setting up the procedure
1. Add enough dry ice to the container and fill it up with ethanol.
2. Set up the thermal incubator to 98oC.
3. If extracting more than one sample make sure to label each one properly, markers will be dissolved during the freeze process once it contains ethanol.

## 7.2 Pre-processing of Sample
1. Centrifuge the oocysts suspension at minimum 16000g for 5 minutes.
2. Carefully, using a pipette and a sterile pipette tip, remove and dispose most of supernatant without disturbing the oocysts pellet, leaving about 50 µl.

## 7.3 DNA Extraction
1. Add 150 µl of ATL buffer to the 1.5 ml tube containing the oocysts, vortex it to dissolve the pellet.
2. Proceed by placing the tube in the ice bath for one minute then place it on the heat block for one minute shaking at 1000rpm.
3. Repeat the step above 24 more times.
4. Add 20 µl of proteinase K
5. Incubate the sample at 56°C for 3 hours at 1000rpm.
6. Add 200 µl of AL buffer and incubate it at 70°C for 10 minutes at 1000rpm.
7. Add 400 µl of absolute ethanol and pipette up and down to mix it.
8. Transfer up to 800 µL of the volume to a spin-column and centrifuge at 8000g for 1min at room temperature. Discard the flow through and repeat process with the additional leftover volume.
9. Add 500 µl of AW1 solution to the spin-column and centrifuge at 8000g for 1 minute.
10. Discard the flow through.
11. Add 500 µl of AW2 solution to the spin-column and centrifuge at 8000g for 1 minute.
12. Discard the flow through or use new collection tube.
13. Centrifuge the column once again to dry the column.
14. Transfer the column to a new 1.5 mL tube.
15. Elute the DNA from the column adding 50 µL of the elution buffer or water to the center of the white filter membrane. **Note:** Heating the elution buffer/water to 50oC prior to use helps to improve the yield.
16. Incubate at room temperature for up to 3 minutes and centrifuge at 10,000g for 1 min.
17. Repeat elution process until DNA cannot be detected on Qubit, using HS reagent. **Note:** if downstream application is enzymatic shearing or digestion, elution buffer containing EDTA is not recommended.

### DNA Extraction from Sorted Cyclospora Oocysts Using Cell Disruptor and ZR Fecal DNA
###Technical Supervisor: Yvonne Qvarnstrom


# 1) Purpose/Principle
This job aid describes the procedures to extract total DNA from oocysts of Cyclospora using cell disruptor to break up the oocysts followed by DNA extraction and purification using ZR Fecal DNA MiniPrep.  This is a standard column based DNA extraction method, with an additional step of cell lysis using a cell disruptor (OmniLyse) to break up the oocysts wall at the beginning of the procedure. In this method, the standard incubation in presence of proteinase K is extended to 1 hour in order to better perform the DNA extraction.

# 6) Safety Precautions 
Use Universal Precautions, including the use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE) when performing the assay.  Wear gloves, lab coat, and eye protection while handling all biological specimens.
a) Refer to the decontamination SOP before and after performing laboratory work for guidance on appropriate disinfectants, waste disposal, and cleanup.
b) The decontamination SOP follows established local, state, and federal regulations for proper handling and disposal methods.
d)  All safety data sheets (SDS) for hazardous chemicals are available in the lab manual titled "SDS".

# 7) Procedure
##7.1 Setting up the procedure
a) Set up the thermal incubator to 56oC

##7.2 Pre-Processing of the Sample
a) Centrifuge the oocysts suspension at minimum 16000g for 5 minutes.
b) Carefully, using a pipette and a sterile pipette tip, remove and dispose most of supernatant without disturbing the oocysts pellet, leaving about 50 µl.  

##7.3 DNA Extraction
a) Add 500 µl of lysis solution buffer to the 1.5 ml tube containing the oocysts, vortex it to dissolve the pellet. 
b) Add 50 µl of proteinase K.
c) Incubate the sample at 56°C for 1 hour at 1000rpm.
d) Connect a syringe to the cell disruptor and connect the disruptor to the battery (OmniLyse).
e) Switch on the battery and pass the volume through the cell disruptor aspirating and dispensing for 1 minute (8 to 12 times). **Obs:** after dispensing the whole extracting volume rinse the beads using maximum of 200 ml of PCR grade water, dispensing the volume into the DNA extraction sample tube.
f) Place a Zymo-Spin column IV – Spin filter on a 2.0 ml collection tube.
g) Transfer the volume to the spin filter and centrifuge for 1 minute at 7000g. Do not discard the pass through volume.
h) Discard the spin filter, add 1200 µl of the binding buffer to the filtrate pipetting up and down to mix it.
i) Place a Zymo-Spin IIC column on a 2 ml collection tube.
j) Transfer 800 µl to the Zymo-Spin IIC column, centrifuge at 10,000g for 1min at room temperature. Discard the flow through and repeat process until all the volume has passed.
k) Add 200 µl of DNA Pre-wash buffer to the zymo spin-column and centrifuge at 10,000g for 1 minute.
l) Discard the flow through.
m) Add 500 µl of Fecal DNA wash buffer to the Zymo spin-column and centrifuge at 10,000g for 1 minute.
n) Transfer the column to a new 2.0 ml collection tube and centrifuge it at a minimum 16,000g for 1 minute to assure that the column has dried.
o) Transfer the column to a 1.5 ml tube and elute the DNA with 50 µl of elution buffer or water.   
**Note:** Heating the elution buffer/water to 50oC prior to use helps to improve the yield. 
p) Incubate at room temperature for up to 3 minutes and centrifuge at 10,000g for 30 seconds. 
q) Repeat elution process until DNA cannot be detected on Qubit, using HS reagent. **Note:** if downstream application is enzymatic shearing or digestion, elution buffer containing EDTA is not recommended.
r) Discard the spin filter and store DNA at -20°C in freezer.
